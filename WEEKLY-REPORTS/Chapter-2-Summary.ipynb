    "  <h1 style=\"color:darkblue\";>Supervised Machine Learning</h1>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    " Is a type of machine learning that create models that have ability to predict outcome from given input and we are provided with input/output pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    " Below are the two supervised machine learning techniques\n",
    " \n",
    "### 1. Classification\n",
    "Its main goal its to predict a class label, which is a choice from predefined list of possibilities. they mainly deal with problems that produce discrete outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can be categorized into two.\n",
    " - **Binary classification** - which is the classification between two classes.\n",
    "    Example of problems solved by binary classification are yes/no problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    " - **Multiclass classification** - is the classification of more than one class.\n",
    "    Example of problems in multiclass classification is \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Regression\n",
    "Its main goal its to predict continous number or floating point number in programming terms. Deals with problems with continous problem outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting, Underfitting and Generalization\n",
    " ### Underfitting\n",
    "- this occurs if the model is too simple, and hence one is not able to capture all aspects of and variability in data. it can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data.\n",
    "- an underfit machine learning model is not suitable model and will be obvious as it will have poor perfomance on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting\n",
    " - this occurs when a model is fit too closely to the particularities of the training set and obtain a model that works well on the training set but doesnt generalize new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- it happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the perfomance of the model on new data.that means the random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model.the problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization\n",
    "- occurs when the the model has the ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Complexity to Dataset size\n",
    "The greater the dataset size the more comple is the model and hence peform well in a given supervised learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Machine Learning Algorithims\n",
    "### 1. K Nearest Neighbour\n",
    " - Used to both classification and Regression problems.\n",
    " - K  nearest  neighbors  is  a simple  algorithm  that  stores  all  available  cases  and  classifies  new  cases by  a majority  vote  of  its  k  neighbors.  The  case being  assigned  to  the  class  is  most common amongst its K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Decision Tree\n",
    " - It is  a  type  of supervised  learning  algorithm  that  is  mostly  used  for classification  problems. \n",
    "  it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. In this algorithm, we split the    population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based  on  most  significant  attributes/  independent  variables  to  make  as  distinct groups as possible.\n",
    " - picture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Linear Models\n",
    "#### i). Linear regression \n",
    "- It is used to estimate real values (cost of houses, number of calls, total sales etc.)based  on  continuous  variable(s). Here,  we  establish  relationship  between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best line. This best fit line is known as regression line and represented by a linear equation Y= ax + b. \n",
    "- Linear Regression  is of mainly two  types: \n",
    "    - Simple Linear Regression - is characterized by one independent variable.\n",
    "    - Multiple Linear Regression(as the name suggests) is characterized by multiple (more than 1) ndependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii). Logistic regression\n",
    "- It is a classification not a  regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values ( Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on given set of independent variables.\n",
    "- it is also known as logit regression. Since,it predicts the probability,its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Naive Bayes\n",
    "- It  is  a  classification  technique  based  on Bayesâ€™  theorem with  an  assumption  of independence  between  predictors. In  simple  terms,  a  Naive  Bayes  classifier assumes  that the  presence  of  a particular  feature  in a  class  is unrelated  to  the presence of any other feature.\n",
